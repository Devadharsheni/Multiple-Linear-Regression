# Multiple-Linear-Regression

Multiple Linear Regression Project:

This project explores the application of multiple linear regression for predicting a continuous target variable based on multiple independent variables.

Project Overview:

This project implements a multiple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between several independent variables x (features) and a dependent variable y (target).

Independent variable (x) : Hours studied,sleep hours, previous score,Sample question paper practiced.

Dependent Variable (y) : Performance Index.

Key Steps:

1.Data Acquisition and Exploration: 

Acquire a dataset containing features and a target variable. Explore the data to understand its characteristics and identify potential issues.

2.Model Training and Evaluation:

Train a multiple linear regression model on the prepared data. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), or adjusted R-squared.

3.Expected Outputs:

It will Visualize the model's performance (e.g., scatter plots, residual plots).

Interpretation of the model coefficients, highlighting the importance of each feature.

4.This project may utilize libraries like:

Pandas (data manipulation)
scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms)
Matplotlib or Seaborn (data visualization)
